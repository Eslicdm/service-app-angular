## Domain: Diagram

* Follow TDD and make a test for each commit/task (when applicable)
* **member-service**: some Manager can CRUD Members
* **pricing-service**: have 3 choices (free, half price, full price), and can edit their price and text description. And can see how many Members selected some choice
* **service-app-registry** register all services in the network
* **service-app-infra** handles all the infra (docker-compose, databases, keycloak, rabbitmq, kafka, redis, etc)
* **service-app-gateway**: organize routes, auth, ratelimiter, load balancer
* **Landing-Feature**: show the 3 choices and description. Some AI (user send a text and AI help make decision). Some Video
* **Member-Feature**: show the Member list and CRUD
* **Pricing-Feature**: show the prices and CRUD
* **Auth-Feature**: make the auth flow



## Later:

* look at the webstorm last history
* Kafka to get Member service requests from landing page, and show in the member-service so the Manager can add
* **notification-service**: send email to Member saying that the Service was confirmed
* Add translation for PT-br
* create readme for each service, and some diagram (Lucidchart, Excalidraw, draw.io, C4)



## To-do:

**Current:**

* make test for navigation
* create the landing page buttons, and configure auth routes, pricing page get and upsert (check the gemini historic)
* create the Pricing-Feature upsert form to create the prices (test the application)
* send a price message to member-service using rabbitmq and cache it with redis (just need to test)
* get the prices in the member-feature and show
* Feature Landing, create 3 cards with the price and description
